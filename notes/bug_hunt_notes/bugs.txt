1. The background was white.
Fix: The one extra color at the end of calculate_light() in
lighting.h should've been black, not white.

2. The triangles where not being shaded.
Fix: forgot to add glm::normalize inside of update_normals().

3. Many pixels were missing!
Fix: Added + 1 to the conditions in the inner two for loops
of calculate_pixel_list_per_box() inside of the box.h header file.
