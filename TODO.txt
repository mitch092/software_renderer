Fix the bugs that are preventing the pixels from displaying.

Replace the RectangularArray<Color> pixels in Data.h
with Frame.

Add this to the blog:
Each triangle gets a bounding box. Each bounding box
needs to store barycentric coordinates. A barycentric coordinate
is 3 floating point numbers. If the triangle takes up the entire
screen and the screen is 1920*1080 pixels, then the bounding
box will be 1920*1080*3 floats * 4 bytes per float.
If I don't resize the inner vectors in JaggedArrays,
then my program could potentially take up (for 2000 triangles
on a 1920*1080 size screen)
2000*1920*1080*3floats*4bytes per float, which is 59 gigabytes.
To fix this, I recycle one buffer for every bounding box.
Now the equation is 1*1920*1080*3*4 bytes, which is 
25 megabytes.
